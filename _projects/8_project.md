The project involved addressing various research problems within the "Integrated System Health Management for Power Systems (ISHM)" initiative. The primary focus was on developing anomaly detection techniques under Phase-II: Fault Detection. An Anomaly Detection System was developed, incorporating an LSTM-based Nominal Behaviour Modelling block and a Non-parametric Dynamic Error Thresholding block. This system was designed to detect anomalies in satellite telemetry data, thereby enhancing the reliability and safety of space subsystems through advanced fault detection methods.
